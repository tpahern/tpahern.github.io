The "cifunk" function will calculate a plot a confidence interval function for any association.

Simply run the R script, then in the R console type 

> cifunk(

and enter the following quantities:
rrpoint,lcl95,ucl95,minhyp,maxhyp,plotpoints

rrpoint:	the estimated relative risk from the study
lcl95:		the lower 95% confidence limit
ucl95:		the upper 95% confidence limit
minhyp:		the minimum hypothesized relative risk (should be less than rrpoint)
maxhyp:		the maximum hypothesized relative risk (should be larger than rrpoint)
plotpoints:	how many points should be plotted between minhyp and maxhyp

Close parentheses and hit enter...
Hypothesized RRs and p-values will print in the console window.
The plot will show the p-value function, a grey vertical null reference line,
and a light blue horizontal reference line for p=0.05.
